# GWAS workflow for cotton nep traits
The scripts included in this repository were used for GWAS and post-GWAS analysis on Cotton neps.

## Custom scripts
To eliminate duplicates, a custom Python script was used.
Additionally, a custom Python script was used to calculate descriptive statistics.
R scripts from the original sources were customized for this dataset to create violin plots, LDHeatmaps, expression heatmaps, and to customize Manhattan plots and local plots.
